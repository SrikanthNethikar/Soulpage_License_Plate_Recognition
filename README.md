## 📌 Summary of Each Day

| Day | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| ✅ **Day 1** | Labeled license plate images using Roboflow and exported dataset in YOLO format |
| ✅ **Day 2** | Trained a YOLOv5s model for 2 epochs using CPU in Google Colab |
| ✅ **Day 3** | Performed inference and saved predictions with bounding boxes on license plates |

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5** – for object detection
- **Roboflow** – for data labeling & format conversion
- **Google Colab (CPU)** – for training and inference
- **Python** – with OpenCV, NumPy, and PyTorch

</div>

These predictions show the model detecting and drawing bounding boxes around license plates.
